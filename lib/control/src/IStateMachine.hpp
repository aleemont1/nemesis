/**
 * @brief Interface for a finite state machine managing rocket flight phases
 * 
 * This interface defines the contract for a state machine that manages the complete
 * lifecycle of a rocket flight, from initialization through recovery. Implementations
 * should handle state transitions, event processing, and task management in a 
 * thread-safe manner suitable for real-time embedded systems.
 * 
 * State Machine Behavior:
 * - States represent distinct phases of rocket operation (INACTIVE, CALIBRATING, etc.)
 * - Events trigger state transitions when specific conditions are met
 * - Transitions can be automatic (time-based, sensor-based) or event-driven
 * - Each state may have associated tasks that run concurrently
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - All methods must be thread-safe for use in multi-core environments
 * - State transitions should be atomic operations
 * - Event handling should be non-blocking where possible
 * 
 * @see RocketState for available states
 * @see FSMEvent for triggerable events
 * @see FlightPhase for high-level flight phases
